#  Customer Income Prediction with Optimized Regression Tree
Python: https://www.python.org/

This project focuses on predicting customer income, empowering businesses with valuable insights for customer segmentation, targeted marketing campaigns, and improved pricing strategies. It uses the power of regression trees, known for their interpretability and efficiency in uncovering nonlinear relationships between variables.

## CRISP-DM

This was designed with the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured and data-driven approach. Where data was explored, treated for analysis, constructed an optimized regression tree, evaluated its performance, and presented the results within an interactive Streamlit dashboard."

## Optimization

The regression tree was optimized for depth, leaf size, and CCP-alpha parameters, achieving a balance between model complexity and generalizability. Tuning the depth prevents overfitting, adjusting the leaf size influences the level of granularity in predictions, and CCP-alpha controls the model's pos pruning for optimal performance.

# Streamlit Dashboard
Streamlit dashboard, offering a seamless means to explore the data. Interact with informative graphs, and delve into the data visualizations.
